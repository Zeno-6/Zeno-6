## About myself

I am a current PhD student studying computational biology. I have an interest in the open-source movement and use Gentoo as a daily driver myself.
Currently I've been doing a bunch of random stuff beyond my primary work, which I will try to sync to this repo. 

Please contact me at zianl_at_tutanota_dot_com if you have any questions; I check my email quite frequently.
